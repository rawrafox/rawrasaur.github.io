I am Aurora and I am a software engineer, I work with Ruby (both JRuby and MRI) and an ERP system called M3 mostly, but I would like to get paid to work with Rust.

This is my blog, we'll see where it takes us, I have some things planned, and some things unplanned. We'll see how that goes, but there will be Ruby, Rust, foxes, cookies, politics and maybe some feelings now and then.

P.S. Right now I'm working on the blog software so we'll see when this posts gets actually posted, my CSS skills aren't that great as you probably already found out when you're reading this.

P.P.S. I never finished my blog software, so here comes Jekyll againâ€¦
